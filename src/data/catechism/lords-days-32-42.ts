        question: "Since we have been delivered from our misery by grace alone through Christ, without any merit of our own, why must we yet do good works?",
        answer: "Because Christ, having redeemed us by his blood, also renews us by his Holy Spirit to be his image, so that with our whole life we may show ourselves thankful to God for his benefits, and he may be praised by us. Further, that we ourselves may be assured of our faith by its fruits, and that by our godly walk of life we may win our neighbors for Christ.",

        id: 98,
        question: "But may images not be tolerated in the churches as \"books for the laity\"?",

        question: "Is the blaspheming of God's name by swearing and cursing such a grievous sin that God is angry also with those who do not prevent and forbid it as much as they can?",
        answer: "Certainly, for no sin is greater or provokes God's wrath more than the blaspheming of his name. That is why he commanded it to be punished with death.",

      {
        id: 102,
        question: "May we also swear by saints or other creatures?",
        answer: "No. A lawful oath is a calling upon God, who alone knows the heart, to bear witness to the truth, and to punish me if I swear falsely. No creature is worthy of such honor.",
