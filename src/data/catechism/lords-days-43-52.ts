        question: "What is required in the ninth commandment?",
        answer: "I must not give false testimony against anyone, twist anyone's words, or gossip or slander, nor condemn or join in condemning anyone rashly and without a hearing. Rather, I must avoid all lying and deceit as the devil's own works, under penalty of God's heavy wrath. In court and everywhere else, I must love the truth, speak and confess it honestly, and do what I can to defend and promote my neighbor's honor and reputation.",

        question: "What does the tenth commandment require of us?",
        answer: "That not even the slightest thought or desire contrary to any of God's commandments should ever arise in our heart. Rather, with all our heart we should always hate all sin and delight in all righteousness.",

        id: 114,
        question: "But can those converted to God keep these commandments perfectly?",
        answer: "No. In this life even the holiest have only a small beginning of this obedience. Nevertheless, with earnest purpose they do begin to live not only according to some but to all the commandments of God.",

      {
        id: 115,
        question: "If in this life no one can keep the ten commandments perfectly, why does God have them preached so strictly?",
        answer: "First, so that throughout our life we may more and more become aware of our sinful nature and seek more eagerly the forgiveness of sins and righteousness in Christ. Second, so that, while praying to God for the grace of the Holy Spirit, we may never stop striving to be renewed more and more after God's image, until after this life we reach the goal of perfection.",

        id: 116,
        question: "Why is prayer necessary for Christians?",
        answer: "Because prayer is the most important part of the thankfulness which God requires of us. Moreover, God will give his grace and the Holy Spirit only to those who constantly and with heartfelt longing ask him for these gifts and thank him for them.",
      },
      {
        id: 117,
        question: "What belongs to a prayer which pleases God and is heard by him?",
        answer: "First, we must from the heart call upon the one true God only, who has revealed himself in his Word, for all that he has commanded us to pray. Second, we must thoroughly know our need and misery, so that we may humble ourselves before God. Third, we must rest on this firm foundation that, although we do not deserve it, God will certainly hear our prayer for the sake of Christ our Lord, as he has promised us in his Word.",

        answer: "And do not bring us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. That is: In ourselves we are so weak that we cannot stand even for a moment. Moreover, our sworn enemies—the devil, the world, and our own flesh—do not cease to attack us. Will you, therefore, uphold and strengthen us by the power of your Holy Spirit, so that in this spiritual war we may not go down to defeat, but always firmly resist our enemies, until we finally obtain the complete victory?",
