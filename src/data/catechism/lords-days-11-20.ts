        question: "Why is the Son of God called Jesus, that is, Saviour?",

        question: "Do those who seek their salvation or well-being in saints, in themselves, or anywhere else, also believe in the only Saviour Jesus?",
        answer: "No. Though they boast of him in words, they in fact deny the only Saviour Jesus. For one of two things must be true: either Jesus is not a complete Saviour, or those who by true faith accept this Saviour must find in him all that is necessary for their salvation.",

      {
        id: 31,
        question: "Why is he called Christ, that is, Anointed?",
        answer: "Because he has been ordained by God the Father, and anointed with the Holy Spirit, to be our chief Prophet and Teacher, who has fully revealed to us the secret counsel and will of God concerning our redemption; our only High Priest, who by the one sacrifice of his body has redeemed us, and who continually intercedes for us before the Father; and our eternal King, who governs us by his Word and Spirit, and who defends and preserves us in the redemption obtained for us.",
      },
      {
        id: 32,
        question: "Why are you called a Christian?",
        answer: "Because I am a member of Christ by faith and thus share in his anointing, so that I may as prophet confess his name, as priest present myself a living sacrifice of thankfulness to him, and as king fight with a free and good conscience against sin and the devil in this life, and hereafter reign with him eternally over all creatures.",

        id: 33,
        question: "Why is he called God's only-begotten Son, since we also are children of God?",

      },
      {
        id: 34,
        question: "Why do you call him our Lord?",
        answer: "Because he has ransomed us, body and soul, from all our sins, not with silver or gold but with his precious blood, and has freed us from all the power of the devil to make us his own possession.",

        answer: "The eternal Son of God, who is and remains true and eternal God, took upon himself true human nature from the flesh and blood of the virgin Mary, through the working of the Holy Spirit. Thus he is also the true seed of David, and like his brothers in every respect, yet without sin.",

        question: "What do you confess when you say that he suffered?",
        answer: "During all the time he lived on earth, but especially at the end, Christ bore in body and soul the wrath of God against the sin of the whole human race. Thus, by his suffering, as the only atoning sacrifice, he has redeemed our body and soul from everlasting damnation, and obtained for us the grace of God, righteousness, and eternal life.",
      },
      {
        id: 38,
        question: "Why did he suffer under Pontius Pilate as judge?",
        answer: "Though innocent, Christ was condemned by an earthly judge, and so he freed us from the severe judgment of God that was to fall on us.",

      {
        id: 39,
        question: "Does it have a special meaning that Christ was crucified and did not die in a different way?",
        answer: "Yes. Thereby I am assured that he took upon himself the curse which lay on me, for a crucified one was cursed by God.",

        id: 40,
        question: "Why was it necessary for Christ to humble himself even unto death?",
        answer: "Because of the justice and truth of God satisfaction for our sins could be made in no other way than by the death of the Son of God.",
      },
      {
        id: 41,
        question: "Why was he buried?",

        id: 42,
        question: "Since Christ has died for us, why do we still have to die?",

        answer: "First, by his resurrection he has overcome death, so that he could make us share in the righteousness which he had obtained for us by his death. Second, by his power we too are raised up to a new life. Third, Christ's resurrection is to us a sure pledge of our glorious resurrection.",
