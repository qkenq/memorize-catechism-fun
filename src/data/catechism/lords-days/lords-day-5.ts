      question: "Since, according to God's righteous judgment, we deserve temporal and eternal punishment, how can we escape this punishment and be again received into favor?",
      answer: "God demands that his justice be satisfied. Therefore, we must make full payment, either by ourselves or through another.",

      question: "Can we by ourselves make this payment?",
      answer: "Certainly not. On the contrary, we daily increase our debt.",

    {
      id: 14,
      question: "Can any mere creature pay for us?",
      answer: "No. In the first place, God will not punish another creature for the sin which man has committed. Furthermore, no mere creature can sustain the burden of God's eternal wrath against sin and deliver others from it.",
