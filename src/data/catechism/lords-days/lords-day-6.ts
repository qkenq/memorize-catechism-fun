      question: "Why must he be a true and righteous man?",
      answer: "He must be a true man because the justice of God requires that the same human nature which has sinned should pay for sin. He must be a righteous man because one who himself is a sinner cannot pay for others.",
    },
    {
      id: 17,
      question: "Why must he at the same time be true God?",
      answer: "He must be true God so that by the power of his divine nature he might bear in his human nature the burden of God's wrath and might obtain for us and restore to us righteousness and life.",
    },
    {
      id: 18,
      question: "But who is that Mediator who at the same time is true God and a true and righteous man?",
      answer: "Our Lord Jesus Christ, who has become for us wisdom from God â€“ that is, our righteousness, holiness, and redemption.",
    },
    {
      id: 19,
      question: "From where do you know this?",
      answer: "From the holy gospel, which God himself first revealed in Paradise. Later, he had it proclaimed by the patriarchs and prophets, and foreshadowed by the sacrifices and other ceremonies of the law. Finally, he had it fulfilled through his only Son.",
