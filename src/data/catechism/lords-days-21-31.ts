And I believe that I am and forever shall remain a living member of it.",

        id: 60,
        question: "How are you righteous before God?",
        answer: "Only by true faith in Jesus Christ. Although my conscience accuses me that I have grievously sinned against all God's commandments, have never kept any of them, and am still inclined to all evil, yet God, without any merit of my own, out of mere grace, imputes to me the perfect satisfaction, righteousness, and holiness of Christ. He grants these to me as if I had never had nor committed any sin, and as if I myself had accomplished all the obedience which Christ has rendered for me, if only I accept this gift with a believing heart.",

        question: "But why can our good works not be our righteousness before God, or at least a part of it?",
        answer: "Because the righteousness which can stand before God's judgment must be absolutely perfect and in complete agreement with the law of God, whereas even our best works in this life are all imperfect and defiled with sin.",

        id: 63,

        question: "Since then faith alone makes us share in Christ and all his benefits, where does this faith come from?",

      },
      {
        id: 66,
        question: "What are the sacraments?",
        answer: "The sacraments are holy, visible signs and seals. They were instituted by God so that by their use he might the more fully declare and seal to us the promise of the gospel. And this is the promise: that God graciously grants us forgiveness of sins and everlasting life because of the one sacrifice of Christ accomplished on the cross.",

        question: "Are both the Word and the sacraments then intended to focus our faith on the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross as the only ground of our salvation?",

        question: "How does holy baptism signify and seal to you that the one sacrifice of Christ on the cross benefits you?",
        answer: "In this way: Christ instituted this outward washing and with it gave the promise that, as sure as water washes away the dirt from the body, so certainly his blood and Spirit wash away the impurity of my soul, that is, all my sins.",
      },
      {
        id: 70,
        question: "What does it mean to be washed with Christ's blood and Spirit?",
        answer: "To be washed with Christ's blood means to receive forgiveness of sins from God, through grace, because of Christ's blood, poured out for us in his sacrifice on the cross. To be washed with his Spirit means to be renewed by the Holy Spirit and sanctified to be members of Christ, so that more and more we become dead to sin and lead a holy and blameless life.",

      {
        id: 71,
        question: "Where has Christ promised that he will wash us with his blood and Spirit as surely as we are washed with the water of baptism?",
        answer: "In the institution of baptism, where he says: Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.",

      },
      {
        id: 73,
        question: "Why then does the Holy Spirit call baptism the washing of regeneration and the washing away of sins?",
        answer: "God speaks in this way for a good reason. He wants to teach us that the blood and Spirit of Christ remove our sins just as water takes away dirt from the body. But, even more important, he wants to assure us by this divine pledge and sign that we are as truly cleansed from our sins spiritually as we are bodily washed with water.",
      },
      {
        id: 74,
        question: "Should infants, too, be baptized?",
        answer: "Yes. Infants as well as adults belong to God's covenant and congregation. Through Christ's blood the redemption from sin and the Holy Spirit, who works faith, are promised to them no less than to adults. Therefore, by baptism, as sign of the covenant, they must be incorporated into the Christian church and distinguished from the children of unbelievers. This was done in the old covenant by circumcision, in place of which baptism was instituted in the new covenant.",
